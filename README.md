# pacman_fun
Just a small little game made with Javascript. 
Some things that still need to be added: 
  -make the Pacman's head turn the direction that it is going
  -create enemies that the pacman has to avoid 
  -have the pacman be able to eat the cherry 
  -have the pacman transform when he eats the cherry
